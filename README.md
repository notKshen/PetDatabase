# Pet Adoption and Care Application Project
## Project Description
Our project aims to model the whole pet adoption and post-adoption animal care ecosystem, allowing users to browse and adopt pets hosted at the shelter, allowing animal specialists like veterinarians to view, store and update a petâ€™s medical documentation and for trainers to work with shelters and train their respective pets.
